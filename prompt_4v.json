    "find_component_example":"Here is an example for your reference so that you can better complete the next tasks: 1. As can be seen from the images, the flexible coupling model mainly consists of three parts: a central shaft, a shaft on each left and right sides, and a flexible coupling structure between the central shaft and the left and right shafts. Each coupling's the flexible structure consists of two flanges, a diaphragm between the flanges, and four fasteners consisting of screws and nuts. 2. It can be considered that the model consists of the following components: Central_Shaft; Flange_Plate_1; Flange_Plate_2; Flange_Plate_3; Flange_Plate_4; Spacer_Ring_1; Spacer_Ring_2; Bolt_1; Bolt_2; Bolt_3; Bolt_4; Nut_1; Nut_2; Nut_3; Nut_4; 3. After observing the shape of each component, the final structured output of the component description is as follows: component_list = { 'central_shaft': 'A cylindrical shaft with a central hole running through its length. Located in the middle of the model.', 'input_shaft': 'A cylindrical shaft with a central hole running through its length. On the far left side of the model.

The ring has a uniform thickness and is placed between the flange plates.', 'spacer_ring_2': 'Identical to Spacer Ring 1, this cylindrical ring also has a central hole and a uniform thickness. It is placed between the flange plates.', 'bolt_1': 'A cylindrical bolt with a hexagonal head, designed to fit through the holes in the flange plates and spacer rings.
